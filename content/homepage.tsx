  WHY_USE_TLSNOTARY: {
    TITLE: "Why use TLSNotary?",
    DESCRIPTION: `TLS (Transport Layer Security), also known as the "s" in "https" üîê, can secure communication between a server and a user. But what if you want to credibly share data with others without compromising security, privacy, or control? </br> </br>TLSNotary solves this by adding a Verifier to the TLS connection using secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC). MPC provides cryptographic guarantees, allowing the Verifier to authenticate the TLS transcript without requiring external trust or revealing the complete data to anyone. TLSNotary can sign (aka¬†notarize) data and make it portable in a privacy preserving way.
    </br></br> With TLSNotary, users are in full control over the data they choose to share.
