TLS (Transport Layer Security), also known as the "s" in "https" üîê, can secure communication between a server and a user. But what if you want to credibly share data with others without compromising security, privacy, or control?

TLSNotary solves this by adding a Verifier to the TLS connection using secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC). MPC provides cryptographic guarantees, allowing the Verifier to authenticate the TLS transcript without requiring external trust or revealing the complete data to anyone. TLSNotary can sign (aka notarize) data and make it portable in a privacy preserving way.

With TLSNotary, users are in full control over the data they choose to share.
